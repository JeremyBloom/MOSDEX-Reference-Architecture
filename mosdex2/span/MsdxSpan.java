/**
 * A Span is an abstraction representing the data streams which connect the
 * MOSDEX object model with the solver specific modeling objects. A Span is
 * intended to work as a distributed, parallel pipeline that does not realize
 * its content except at its origin and destination. A Span transforms the data
 * that passes through it according to an Operator. Operators are the means by
 * which a solver Modeling Factory specifies the transformations necessary to
 * create and use the solver-specific API in MOSDEX. The sequence of Spans that
 * transforms MOSDEX data into solver-specific modeling objects is called a
 * bridge.
 * <p>
 * The MOSDEX Span interface is implemented with two concrete classes, based on
 * Java streams or on Apache Spark distributed data sets. The interface specifies the
 * key operations on Spans, which are a subset of the operations available for
 * Spark distributed datasets and Java streams.
 * <p>
 * The fundamental component of the Span interface is the Container class. A
 * Container holds heterogeneous data together with their class identities, which
 * constitutes the Container's schema. All Containers in a Span must have the
 * same schema.
 * <p>
 * The classes implementing MsdxSpan do not have public constructors. Instead,
 * each has a companion, static member class implementing the MsdxSpan.Factory
 * interface. The create methods of this companion class provide for
 * construction of Span objects from various input data structures.

	 * The Span Factory interface provides a number of utility methods that create and manipulate Spans. 
	 * The wrap method puts a Span facade around a Record stream or collection.
	 * The create method copies a Record stream or collection into a Span.
	 * The union method flatmaps several Spans into a single Span. 
	 * <p>
	 * Classes implementing the MsdxSpan interface must also have a static member class 
	 * that implements the Factory interface. A class implementing the Factory must have a 
	 * public constructor or static factory to create a Factory instance.
